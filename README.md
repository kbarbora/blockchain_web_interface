# Blockchain web interface
Demo of a blockchain using a web interface. It is based on the course on https://www.udemy.com/course/build-a-blockchain-cryptocurrency-using-python/. Implements a web interface for client and node. It can create wallets for users and once you have the public sender key, private sender key and the receiver public key you can make transactions with the desired amount. Since it is only a demo, users can send unlimited amounts of coins to users.
